# BigTable review

A distributed storage system for managing structed data.

## Introduction

1) Dose not support full relational data model

2) It provides clients with a simple data model which support the dynamic control over data layout and format.

3) Data is indexed using row and column names that can be arbirtary strings.



## Data model

sparse, distributed, persistent multi-dimensional sorted map!

map is indexed by a row key, column key and a timestamp.

each value is an uniterpreted array of bytes.

### Rows

Every read and write under a single row key is atomic, maintains data in lexicographic order by row key.

Each row range is call the tablet, which is unit of distribution and load balancing.

1) row keys are organize in lexicographic order;

2) the range of row is call the tablet;

3) client can store the rows key to same prefix(reverse the url) to achieve the range query.



### Column Families

intent  the number of distinct column families in a table be small, a tale may have an unbounded number of columns.

a column key is named using the following syntax: family:qualifier.



### Timestamps

Contain mult versions of the same data; these versions are indexed by timestamp.
